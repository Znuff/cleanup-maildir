The cleanup-maildir py script floating around on the net did not work
with a host I read mail on that runs python 2.5.2. I patched it, then
a week later realized that , then realized I also read mail on a box
that only has python 2.4. So this now works with both.

Note that using 'INBOX' refers to your root maildir (~/Maildir)

Example usage:

cleanup-maildir -d 1 --age=120 --archive-folder=Archive archive INBOX
cleanup-maildir -d 1 --age=90 --archive-folder=Archive.src archive src
